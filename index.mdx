# MRS: Music Representation Syntax

**MRS enables AI-driven composition of full orchestral works—symphonies, vocal arrangements, film scores—through iterative conversation with humans in the loop.**

Think of it as the **"opencode of Dorico"**: professional-grade notation infrastructure designed from the ground up for agent-driven workflows. The goal is the hardest version of the problem: creating complex, multi-movement works from scratch with the granularity required for professional projects.

## Why MRS?

AI cannot currently compose or edit full orchestral scores reliably. Three fundamental challenges block progress:

1. **Scale**: A full orchestral score (~1.5M tokens) exceeds any context window
2. **Context**: Musical decisions require understanding surrounding material
3. **Fragility**: Existing formats use positional references that break during editing

MRS solves these through **UUID-first identity**, **context-aware extraction**, and a **single-writer orchestrator pattern** that makes iterative AI composition safe and reliable.

**Is this approach feasible?** [Yes—read the detailed analysis →](/problem-and-approach)

## Core Components

- **MRS-S**: A single canonical format (S-expression based) for complete, archival-quality scores with stable UUID identifiers
- **Working Set Envelopes**: Scoped MRS-S fragments with context rings for bounded agent operations
- **Synopsis**: Compressed structural views providing global awareness
- **Overlays**: Analytical metadata attached to score regions
- **Orchestrator**: Single-writer coordinator with edit lanes for safe multi-agent workflows

## Key Features

### Stable Identity
Every measure, event, and span carries a stable UUIDv7 identifier. Measure numbers are display properties—all internal references use UUIDs, ensuring structural stability through insertions, deletions, and reorderings.

### Context-Aware Extraction
Working Set Envelopes provide not just the edit region, but graduated context rings with surrounding material at reduced detail, plus synopsis access for global structural awareness.

### Single Syntax
Agents receive valid MRS-S and return valid MRS-S. There is no second format, no abbreviations, no context-dependent parsing. Extraction and replacement are trivial operations.

### Edit Lanes
Multiple agents can work in parallel on the same region with different concerns (notes, dynamics, lyrics). The orchestrator merges changes safely based on lane ownership.

### Draft States
First-class support for intentionally incomplete content. Placeholder regions, sketch rhythms, and harmonic plans without full voicings enable natural iterative workflows.

### Human-in-the-Loop
Checkpoints lock approved decisions (form, harmony, orchestration). Human review gates ensure quality at critical junctures.

## The Hardest Version of the Problem

MRS is designed for symphonies-from-scratch: iterative creation of complex multi-movement works through AI conversation. This means supporting:

- **Structural creation**: Insert measures, sections, movements—not just edit existing content
- **Incomplete states**: Early-stage work has placeholders ("strings texture TBD")
- **Cross-boundary spans**: Hairpins, slurs that cross edit boundaries
- **Human checkpoints**: Lock form, lock harmony, lock orchestration progressively
- **Conflict-free iteration**: Multiple agents contributing without destructive overwrites

If MRS handles symphonies-from-scratch, it handles everything simpler too.
