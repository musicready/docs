# MRS: Music Representation Syntax

MRS is a format for encoding musical scores optimized for AI-assisted composition workflows. It provides:

- **MRS-S**: A single canonical format (S-expression based) for complete, archival-quality scores with stable UUID identifiers
- **Working Set Envelopes**: Scoped MRS-S fragments with context rings for bounded agent operations
- **Synopsis**: Compressed structural views providing global awareness
- **Overlays**: Analytical metadata attached to score regions

## Key Features

### Stable Identity
Every measure, event, and span carries a stable UUIDv7 identifier. Measure numbers are display properties—all internal references use UUIDs, ensuring structural stability through insertions, deletions, and reorderings.

### Context-Aware Extraction
Working Set Envelopes provide not just the edit region, but graduated context rings with surrounding material at reduced detail, plus synopsis access for global structural awareness.

### Single Syntax
Agents receive valid MRS-S and return valid MRS-S. There is no second format, no abbreviations, no context-dependent parsing. Extraction and replacement are trivial operations.

### Sequential Workflow Support
Composition is fundamentally sequential at the structural level. MRS supports fluid workflows where form and structure emerge through the creative process, with UUIDs ensuring reference stability.
