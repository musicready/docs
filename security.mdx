See: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#15-security-considerations`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#15-security-considerations)

## Input Validation

Parsers MUST validate input before processing:

- Maximum document size limits
- Maximum nesting depth limits
- Maximum event count per measure
- Valid Unicode in strings

## Denial of Service Protection

Implementations SHOULD protect against:

- Deeply nested structures (stack overflow)
- Very large measure numbers (memory exhaustion)
- Excessive span counts (O(n²) algorithms)
- Malformed UTF-8 sequences

## Information Disclosure

Working Set Envelopes may expose:

- Source document structure (via `:scope`)
- Source document hash (for conflict detection)
- Creator/modifier identity (via `:agent-id`)

Implementations SHOULD allow redaction of sensitive metadata when sharing working sets externally.
