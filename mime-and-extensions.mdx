| Format | MIME Type | Extensions |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| MRS-S | `application/vnd.mrs+sexpr` | `.mrs`, `.mrs-s` |
| Working Set Envelope | `application/vnd.mrs+sexpr` | `.mrs-work` (optional) |

Working Set Envelopes use the same MIME type as MRS-S because they contain valid MRS-S content. They are typically ephemeral (passed in-memory between orchestrator and agents) rather than persisted to files.

MRS documents must be UTF-8 encoded (BOM should not be used).
