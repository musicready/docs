See: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#14-mime-types-and-file-extensions`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#14-mime-types-and-file-extensions)

## MIME Types

| Format | MIME Type |
|--------|-----------|
| MRS-S | `application/vnd.mrs+sexpr` |
| Working Set Envelope | `application/vnd.mrs+sexpr` |

## File Extensions

| Format | Extension |
|--------|-----------|
| MRS-S | `.mrs` or `.mrs-s` |
| Working Set Envelope | `.mrs-work` (typically ephemeral) |

Note: Working Set Envelopes are typically not persisted to files—they exist as in-memory structures passed between orchestrator and agents.

## Encoding

MRS documents MUST be encoded in UTF-8. The BOM (Byte Order Mark) SHOULD NOT be used.
