See: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#16-mime-types-and-file-extensions`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#16-mime-types-and-file-extensions)

## MIME Types

| Format | MIME Type |
|--------|-----------|
| MRS-S | `application/vnd.mrs+sexpr` |
| MRS-Ops | `application/vnd.mrs-ops+sexpr` |
| Working Set Envelope | `application/vnd.mrs-workset+sexpr` |

## File Extensions

| Format | Extension | Persistence |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| MRS-S | `.mrs` or `.mrs-s` | Persisted (canonical storage) |
| MRS-Ops | `.mrs-ops` | Typically ephemeral |
| Working Set | `.mrs-workset` | Typically ephemeral |

### Persistence Notes

**MRS-S** is the only format intended for long-term storage. It represents the complete, archival-quality canonical state of a score.

**MRS-Ops** and **Working Set Envelopes** exist as in-memory structures passed between orchestrator and agents. While they can be serialized for debugging or audit logs, they are not typically stored as files.

## Encoding

MRS documents MUST be encoded in UTF-8. The BOM (Byte Order Mark) SHOULD NOT be used.
