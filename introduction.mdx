## Abstract

MRS (Music Representation Syntax) is a format for encoding musical scores optimized for AI-assisted composition workflows:

- **MRS-S**: A single canonical format (S-expression based) for complete, archival-quality scores
- **Working Set Envelopes**: Scoped MRS-S fragments with metadata for bounded agent operations

Agents receive valid MRS-S and return valid MRS-S—no second syntax, no format conversion, no parsing ambiguity.

See: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#abstract`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#abstract)

## Motivation

The RFC motivates MRS as a bridge between:

- **Interchange formats** that are complete but verbose and difficult to edit at scale
- **Compact notations** that are easy to type but lack a fully deterministic, semantically complete model

MRS explicitly targets the **scale problem**: editing should not require loading or reasoning about the entire score.

See: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#1-1-motivation`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#1-1-motivation)

## Goals

The RFC's goals include:

1. **Semantic completeness**
2. **Deterministic parsing**
3. **Local reasoning**
4. **Machine-friendly generation**
5. **Human auditability**
6. **Diff-friendly structure**
7. **Renderer-agnostic semantics**

See: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#1-2-goals`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#1-2-goals)

## Non-goals

MRS explicitly does *not* attempt to:

- Encode detailed visual layout (beyond optional hints)
- Provide a programming language (no loops/macros/conditionals)
- Define synthesis/playback behavior
- Replace domain-specific formats (e.g. audio, MIDI, engraving source)

See: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#1-3-non-goals`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#1-3-non-goals)

## Terminology

Key terms used throughout the spec:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Score | A complete musical work in MRS format |
| Part | A single instrument or voice throughout a score |
| Staff | A visual grouping of five lines; parts may have multiple staves |
| Voice | An independent melodic/rhythmic stream within a staff |
| Measure | A metrical unit bounded by barlines |
| Event | An atomic musical occurrence (note, rest, chord) |
| Span | A relation connecting multiple events (slur, beam, hairpin) |
| Working Set Envelope | A scoped MRS-S fragment with metadata for agent tasks |
| Orchestrator | System that coordinates agent tasks and manages the full score |
