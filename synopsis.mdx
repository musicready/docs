title: "Synopsis Format"
description: "Compressed structural views providing global awareness for agent operations."
---

The Synopsis is a compressed structural view of the full score. It provides global context without full detail.

See: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#6-synopsis-format`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#6-synopsis-format)

## Characteristics

The Synopsis is:

- **Derived**: Computed from full MRS-S
- **Read-only**: Agents cannot modify it
- **Lossy by design**: Context, not content

## Structure

```clojure
(synopsis
  :hash "sha256:abc123..."
  :source-hash "sha256:def456..."
  
  :structure
    (movement 1 :title "Allegro" 
      :first-measure #uuid "018c3f40-0001-..." 
      :last-measure #uuid "018c3f40-0144-..."
      :display-range [1 324]
      :key C :mode minor)
  
  :parts
    (part violin-1 :section strings :range [G3 E7])
    (part clarinet-1 :section woodwinds :transposition (down M2))
  
  :harmonic-spine
    ((:measures #uuid "..." #uuid "..."
      :key Cm :function i :display-range [1 8])
     (:measures #uuid "..." #uuid "..."
      :key Eb :function III :display-range [9 16]))
  
  :thematic-regions
    ((theme-a 
      :first-appearance #uuid "..."
      :display-measure 1
      :parts [violin-1] 
      :recurrences [#uuid "..." #uuid "..."])
     (theme-b 
      :first-appearance #uuid "..."
      :parts [cello]))
  
  :density-profile
    ((:measures #uuid "..." #uuid "..."
      :avg-events-per-beat 2.3 
      :active-parts 4))
  
  :rehearsal-map
    ((A #uuid "..." :display 1)
     (B #uuid "..." :display 32)
     (C #uuid "..." :display 64)))
```

## Synopsis Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `:hash` | SHA-256 of the synopsis itself |
| `:source-hash` | SHA-256 of the MRS-S it was derived from |
| `:structure` | Movement/section boundaries |
| `:parts` | Part summary (section, range, transposition) |
| `:harmonic-spine` | Chord progression and key areas |
| `:thematic-regions` | Theme appearances and recurrences |
| `:density-profile` | Texture information by region |
| `:rehearsal-map` | Rehearsal marks with UUID/measure mappings |

## Access

Working Set Envelopes reference the synopsis by hash:

```clojure
(working-set
  ...
  :synopsis-ref "sha256:abc123...")
```

Agents can query the orchestrator:

```clojure
(query
  :type synopsis
  :ref "sha256:abc123..."
  :response (synopsis ...))
```
