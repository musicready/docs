| Aspect | MRS-S | MusicXML | ABC Notation | LilyPond |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Syntax | S-expression | XML | Custom text | Custom text |
| Formal grammar | Yes | Yes (XSD) | Partial | No |
| Agent-friendly | Yes | No | Partial | No |
| Full score support | Yes | Yes | Limited | Yes |
| Semantic precision | High | High | Low | Medium |
| Local editing | Yes | Difficult | Difficult | Difficult |

MRS-S combines the semantic precision of MusicXML with the parsability of S-expressions and native support for scoped agent operations via Working Set Envelopes.
