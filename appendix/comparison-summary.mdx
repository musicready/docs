## Format Comparison

| Aspect | MRS | MusicXML | ABC | LilyPond | MEI |
|--------|-----|----------|-----|----------|-----|
| **Syntax** | S-expression | XML | Custom text | Custom text | XML |
| **Formal grammar** | Yes | Yes (XSD) | Partial | No | Yes (RNG) |
| **UUID identifiers** | Yes | No | No | No | Optional |
| **Mutation protocol** | MRS-Ops | None | None | None | None |
| **Context extraction** | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| **Agent-optimized** | Yes | No | Partial | No | No |
| **Full score support** | Yes | Yes | Limited | Yes | Yes |
| **Semantic precision** | High | High | Low | Medium | High |
| **Local editing** | Yes | Difficult | Difficult | Difficult | Difficult |

## Key Differentiators

### Separation of Storage and Mutation

MRS is unique in providing separate formats optimized for different purposes:

| Format | Purpose | Optimization |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| MRS-S | Storage, interchange, archival | Completeness, human readability |
| MRS-Ops | Agent mutations | Reliability, minimal surface, explicit intent |

Other formats use a single representation for both reading and writing, which creates challenges for AI agents.

### Orchestrator-Derived Fields

| Approach | Formats | Problem |
|----------|---------|---------|
| Agent computes `:at` | MusicXML, LilyPond | Calculation errors, synchronization bugs |
| Orchestrator computes `:at` | MRS | Single source of truth, no agent math |

### Professional Orchestration Model

| Model | Formats | Limitation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Part = Instrument | Most formats | Cannot represent instrument doubling |
| Player → Instruments | MRS | Full orchestration semantics |

MRS supports:
- Flute 2 / Piccolo doublings
- Mid-score instrument changes
- Transposition handling across changes
- Percussion kits
- Condensed scores and divisi

### Task-Adaptive Context

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Fixed context (all surrounding measures) | May include irrelevant content, omit critical content |
| Task-adaptive views | Agent receives exactly what's needed for the task |

MRS context views include:
- `melodic-reference`: The melody to respond to
- `harmonic-context`: Chord progression
- `orchestration-map`: Active instruments, texture
- `phrase-structure`: Phrase boundaries
- `dynamics-profile`: Dynamics trajectory

## Why Not Use Existing Formats?

### MusicXML
- Verbose XML syntax expands token count
- No UUID stability (structural references break on edit)
- No separation of read/write formats
- No context extraction mechanism

### LilyPond
- Designed for human editing, not AI consumption
- Implicit voice numbering creates ambiguity
- No UUID identifiers
- Difficult to extract and replace sections

### MEI
- Designed for scholarly encoding, not composition workflows
- Heavy XML syntax
- No mutation protocol
- Primarily archival rather than operational

### ABC Notation
- Limited to simple monophonic music
- No full score support
- No semantic precision for orchestral works

## Summary

MRS combines:
- The semantic precision of MusicXML and MEI
- The parsability of S-expressions
- Stable UUID identifiers for structural stability
- Typed mutation protocol (MRS-Ops) for reliable agent output
- Task-adaptive context views for relevant information
- Professional orchestration semantics (Player → Instrument → Staff)
- Progressive validation before state mutation

This architecture enables reliable AI-assisted composition at scales (full orchestral works) that are impossible with existing formats.
