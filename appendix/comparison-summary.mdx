| Aspect | MRS-S | MusicXML | ABC Notation | LilyPond |
|--------|-------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Syntax | S-expression | XML | Custom text | Custom text |
| Formal grammar | Yes | Yes (XSD) | Partial | No |
| UUID identifiers | Yes | No | No | No |
| Context-aware extraction | Yes | No | No | No |
| Agent-friendly | Yes | No | Partial | No |
| Full score support | Yes | Yes | Limited | Yes |
| Semantic precision | High | High | Low | Medium |
| Local editing | Yes | Difficult | Difficult | Difficult |

MRS-S combines the semantic precision of MusicXML with the parsability of S-expressions, stable UUID identifiers for structural stability, and native support for context-aware agent operations via Working Set Envelopes with context rings and synopsis access.
