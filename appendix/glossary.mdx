| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Agent** | An AI system that reads MRS-S fragments and writes MRS-Ops |
| **Beat** | A metrical position within a measure (0-indexed, rational) |
| **Chord** | Multiple simultaneous pitches with shared duration |
| **Context View** | Task-adaptive information beyond the edit scope (read-only) |
| **Derived Field** | A field computed by the orchestrator (`:at`, `:beat-start`, `:sec-start`) |
| **Event** | An atomic musical occurrence at a specific beat, identified by UUID |
| **Extraction** | Creating a Working Set Envelope from a source MRS-S |
| **Instrument** | A specific sound source with fixed transposition and range |
| **Lane** | A permission boundary for a category of content |
| **Lane Bundle** | A predefined set of lanes for common workflows |
| **Measure** | A metrical unit bounded by barlines, identified by UUID |
| **MRS-Ops** | The typed operation protocol for agent mutations |
| **MRS-S** | The canonical storage format (S-expression based) |
| **Orchestrator** | System that owns canonical state, mints UUIDs, computes derived fields, validates and applies operations |
| **Overlay** | Analytical metadata attached to score regions |
| **Player** | A performer who may play multiple instruments |
| **Progressive Validation** | Multi-stage validation before state mutation |
| **Replacement** | Applying validated MRS-Ops operations to canonical state |
| **Scope** | UUID-based boundaries of a Working Set |
| **Span** | A relation connecting multiple events (slur, tie, beam, etc.) |
| **Staff** | A visual grouping of five lines; instruments may have multiple staves |
| **Structural Index** | A compressed global view of the full score (read-only) |
| **Temporary ID** | Agent-assigned identifier mapped to UUID by orchestrator |
| **Voice** | An independent melodic/rhythmic stream within a staff |
| **Working Set Envelope** | A scoped MRS-S fragment with task-adaptive context for agent tasks |
