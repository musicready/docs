## Key Changes in 1.0

### Architectural

1. **MRS-Ops**: New typed operation protocol for agent mutations. Agents read MRS-S but write typed operations (create-event, update-event, delete-event, etc.)

2. **Orchestrator Authority**: Orchestrator is the sole authority for:
   - UUID minting (agents use temporary IDs)
   - Derived field computation (`:at`, `:beat-start`, `:sec-start`)
   - Canonical state management

3. **Progressive Validation**: Operations validated in stages before application (syntax → references → permissions → musical rules → application)

### Data Model

4. **Player-Instrument-Staff Model**: Replaced Part=Instrument with professional orchestration semantics:
   - Players own instruments (supporting doublings)
   - Instruments have staves, transposition, ranges
   - Mid-score instrument changes supported

5. **Percussion Kits**: Explicit support for kit definitions with component instruments

### Context and Permissions

6. **Task-Adaptive Context Views**: Replaced fixed "near/far" context rings with dynamic views tailored to specific task types (melodic-reference, harmonic-context, orchestration-map, etc.)

7. **Lane Bundles**: Predefined permission sets for common workflows (orchestrate, dynamics-pass, notation-cleanup, full-compose)

### Syntax

8. **Canonical Rational Syntax**: Removed decimal literals; enforced `2+1/2` format for beat positions

9. **Structural Index**: Renamed from "Synopsis" for clarity
