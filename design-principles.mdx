MRS is built on principles derived from the real requirements of AI-assisted composition at professional scale.

See: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#2-design-principles`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#2-design-principles)

## Separation of Concerns: Storage vs Mutation

MRS uses different representations optimized for different purposes:

| Concern | Format | Optimized For |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Storage, interchange, archival | MRS-S | Completeness, human readability, validation |
| Agent output, mutations | MRS-Ops | Reliability, minimal surface, explicit intent |

**Rationale**: Asking agents to emit complete, valid score fragments creates high failure rates from accidental omissions, calculation errors, and hallucinated references. Typed operations with orchestrator-derived fields eliminate entire error classes.

```clojure
;; Agent reads MRS-S (complete, human-auditable)
(measure :id #uuid "..." :number 45
  (clarinet-bb
    (v1
      (: 0 C5.q :id #uuid "...")
      (: 1 D5.q :id #uuid "..."))))

;; Agent writes MRS-Ops (typed, minimal)
(create-event :tmp-id "e1" :measure #uuid "..." 
              :instrument clarinet-bb :voice v1
              :beat 2 :pitch E5 :duration q :dyn mf)
```

## Orchestrator Authority

The orchestrator is the sole authority for:
- **UUID minting**: Agents use temporary IDs; orchestrator assigns final UUIDs
- **Derived field computation**: Orchestrator computes `:at`, `:beat-start`, etc.
- **Canonical state management**: Single source of truth
- **Validation and application**: Progressive validation before state mutation

**Rationale**: Centralized authority eliminates coordination failures. Agents cannot create invalid references or miscalculate derived fields because they don't manage those concerns.

## Stable Identity Over Positional Reference

Every measure, event, and span carries a stable UUIDv7 identifier. Measure numbers are display properties for human navigation, not structural identity.

```clojure
(measure 
  :id #uuid "018c3f40-1234-7890-abcd-ef1234567890"  ; Stable—survives edits
  :number 45                                         ; Display only—can change
  :beat-start 487
  ...)
```

**Rationale**: Positional references break when content is inserted or deleted. UUID references survive structural changes, enabling fluid compositional workflows where form evolves during the creative process.

## Progressive Validation

Operations are validated in stages before application:

```
Syntax → References → Permissions → Musical Rules → Application
```

**Rationale**: Errors caught before state mutation enable specific feedback, partial acceptance, and no silent corruption. This is fundamentally different from "emit fragment, hope it validates."

## Task-Adaptive Context

Agents receive context views tailored to their specific task, not fixed "near/far" rings.

| Task Type | Context Views |
|-----------|---------------|
| Countermelody | Melodic reference, harmonic context |
| Orchestration | Orchestration map, texture density |
| Dynamics pass | Phrase structure, dynamics profile |

**Rationale**: Fixed rings may include irrelevant content and omit critical content. A countermelody task needs the melody it responds to, not "nearby measures at melodic-skeleton reduction."

## Professional Orchestration Semantics

The Player → Instrument → Staff model supports real-world orchestration:

```clojure
(player woodwind-2
  :name "Flute 2 / Piccolo"
  :instruments [flute-2 piccolo]
  :default flute-2)
```

**Rationale**: Arrangers and orchestrators work with players and instrument changes constantly. Flute 2 doubling piccolo is not an edge case—it's standard practice. The model must reflect professional reality.

## Explicit Over Implicit

Every musical element has an explicit representation. Position in the measure is stated, not inferred from accumulated durations. Voice assignment is declared, not guessed from stem direction.

**Rationale**: Implicit state creates cascading errors. If an LLM miscounts one duration, all subsequent events are misaligned. Explicit positions are independently verifiable.

## Semantic Over Visual

MRS encodes musical meaning, not visual appearance. A crescendo is marked with start/end points and type, not with specific hairpin coordinates.

**Rationale**: Visual rendering is context-dependent (page size, staff spacing, font). Semantic encoding remains valid across all rendering contexts.

## Predictable Over Clever

The format uses regular patterns even when more compact alternatives exist. Every note uses the same syntax regardless of context.

**Rationale**: LLMs generate more reliably when patterns are consistent. A 10% size reduction is not worth a 50% increase in generation errors.

## Canonical Rational Syntax

All temporal positions use exact rationals in a single canonical form:

```
Permitted:   0, 1, 2+1/2, 0+1/3, 3+3/4
Forbidden:   2.5, 0.333, 1.75  (decimal literals)
```

**Rationale**: Decimal literals invite floating-point parsing and normalization ambiguity. One canonical form eliminates entire error classes.
