This page summarizes the design principles stated in the RFC. For normative wording, see: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#2-design-principles`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#2-design-principles).

## Explicit over implicit

- Musical position is **stated**, not inferred (beat positions are explicit).
- Voice assignment is **declared**, not guessed.

Rationale: implicit state can cascade into large misalignments; explicit positions are independently verifiable.

## Stable identity over positional reference

- Measures and events carry **stable UUIDv7 identifiers**.
- Measure numbers are **display properties** for human navigation, not structural identity.
- All internal references use **UUIDs**, not measure numbers.

Rationale: positional references break when content is inserted or deleted. UUID references survive structural changes, enabling fluid compositional workflows.

## Semantic over visual

- Encode **meaning** (e.g., crescendo as start/end + type), not visual coordinates.

Rationale: rendering is context-dependent; semantics remain stable across rendering contexts.

## Predictable over clever

- Prefer **regular patterns** to reduce generation and editing errors.

Rationale: consistent syntax improves reliability (especially for machine generation).

## Context over isolation

- Working Sets include **graduated context rings**—surrounding material at reduced detail.
- Agents have **synopsis access** for global structural awareness.

Rationale: musical decisions are contextual. A countermelody responds to what precedes and follows. Phrase boundaries, harmonic rhythm, and thematic relationships inform compositional choices.

## One format, scoped extraction

- MRS uses a **single syntax** (MRS-S) for all operations.
- Working Set Envelopes extract **bounded fragments** with scope metadata and context.
- Agents receive MRS-S and return MRS-S—no format conversion.

Rationale: maintaining two syntaxes creates parsing complexity, abbreviation ambiguity, and merge conflicts. A single syntax means extraction and replacement are trivial operations.
