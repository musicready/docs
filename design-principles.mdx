This page summarizes the design principles stated in the RFC. For normative wording, see: [`/MRS-Specification-RFC#2-design-principles`](/MRS-Specification-RFC#2-design-principles).

## Explicit over implicit

- Musical position is **stated**, not inferred (beat positions are explicit).
- Voice assignment is **declared**, not guessed.

Rationale: implicit state can cascade into large misalignments; explicit positions are independently verifiable.

## Local over global

- References are **path-based** (e.g., `m45.violin.b2`) rather than global opaque IDs.
- Measures are intended to be **self-contained** and independently parseable.

Rationale: global state makes edits fragile; path-based references survive insertions/deletions without renumbering.

## Semantic over visual

- Encode **meaning** (e.g., crescendo as start/end + type), not visual coordinates.

Rationale: rendering is context-dependent; semantics remain stable across rendering contexts.

## Predictable over clever

- Prefer **regular patterns** to reduce generation and editing errors.

Rationale: consistent syntax improves reliability (especially for machine generation).

## One format, scoped extraction

- MRS uses a **single syntax** (MRS-S) for all operations.
- Working Set Envelopes extract **bounded fragments** with scope metadata.
- Agents receive MRS-S and return MRS-S—no format conversion.

Rationale: maintaining two syntaxes creates parsing complexity, abbreviation ambiguity, and merge conflicts. A single syntax means extraction and replacement are trivial operations.
