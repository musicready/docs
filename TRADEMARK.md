# MusicReady / MRS Trademark Policy

“MusicReady” and “MRS” are unregistered trademarks of PraiseCharts Publishing Ltd.

Until formal registration is complete, we assert common-law trademark rights in all jurisdictions that recognize them (USA, UK, Canada, EU, etc.).

Permission is automatically granted to use the marks “MusicReady” and “MRS” under the following conditions:

- The software or service fully and correctly implements the latest ratified MRS specification.
- The use is not likely to cause confusion about source or official status.
- You do not claim the software is the official reference implementation unless explicitly designated by the MusicReady maintainers.

Any other use (including forked or incompatible implementations that still call themselves “MRS”) requires written permission.

We reserve the right to revoke this permission at any time for non-conforming or misleading uses.
